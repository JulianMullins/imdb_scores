# IMDb Score Predictor
This website is the interactive accompaniment to a final project in my "Case Studies in Business Analytics" class. After analyzing a dataset of movies consisting of 5,043 records and 28 variables, we cleaned and partitioned the data and ran various prediction models such as Multiple Linear Regression, the K-Nearest Neighbors approach and Regression Trees in order to come up with a final (best) model.

This website is based on the final model we chose that uses multiple linear regression with 12 variables to predict a movie's IMDb Score. Each of the website's form elements correspond to one of these variables (excluding movie title).

This project was developed using the Express.js framework.
